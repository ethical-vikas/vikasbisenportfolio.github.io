<h2 style="color: ALICEBLUE; font-size: 40px; text-align: center; color: blue;">GITHUB CLONE FROM GITHUB</h2>
<P style="font-size: 30PX; padding-left: 30px; color: aliceblue;"> China’s approved GitHub clone, Gitee, has warned users that it will make all existing repositories private pending a mysterious review of their content.

    Gitee offers Git and Apache Subversion as a service. But while GitHub has occasionally been banned in China, Gitee was anointed as China’s designated open source development hub in 2020, after the nation’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology conducted a bidding process.
    
    The Reg keeps an eye on Gitee and sees a steady stream of blog posts about product and service updates, plus news of open source software in China. The service is sufficiently committed to the cause of open source to have signed up to mirror Linux Foundation code and is thought to have around eight million users.
    
    The company published news of its code review requirements on a platform called Zhihu.com, a Q&A service similar to US-based Quora.</P>
